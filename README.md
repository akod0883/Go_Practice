# GoLang Projects

This repository contains several Go projects that demonstrate proficiency and knowledge in GoLang. The projects are organized into different directories, each focusing on specific aspects of Go development.

## Directories

### core_concepts

The `core_concepts` directory contains code that demonstrates the core concepts of GoLang. It covers fundamental concepts such as variables, functions, control structures, data types, pointers, and more. This section serves as a foundational resource for understanding the basics of Go development.

### parallel_data_processing

The `parallel_data_processing` directory showcases skills in utilizing Go routines, channels, and load-balancing mechanisms. The project within this directory handles large CSV files containing sentences and counts the occurrences of each word. It leverages Go's concurrency features to process the data in parallel, improving performance and efficiency.

### socket_chat

The `socket_chat` directory contains a project that implements a chat application using network sockets. It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and communicate with each other in a chatroom-like environment. The project demonstrates knowledge of socket programming and networking concepts in GoLang.

### webserver

The `webserver` directory contains code for creating a web server using GoLang. It showcases the ability to handle HTTP requests, route them to appropriate handlers, and serve dynamic or static content. This project highlights skills in web development using Go.

## Usage

To use any of the projects in this repository, follow the instructions provided within each directory's respective README file. Each project may have its own set of dependencies or specific instructions for running and testing.

Feel free to explore each directory and the projects within to gain insights into different aspects of GoLang development.
