# Go_Practice

This repo contains files that I used to practice my skills with Golang

## Getting Started
1) Go [1.20.3](https://go.dev/doc/install)

2) Internet Connection

## List of FIles
- `greetings/go.mod`
- `greetings/greetings.go`
- `greetings/greetings_test.go`
- `hello/go.mod`
- `hello/hello.go`

Each directory contains a `go.mod` file that acts as definition for each module's dependencies and version requirements.

## Setup and Run

#### Setup
All that is needed to run the code within this repository is to install Go given the hyperlink at the top of the repo.


#### Run
Run the command `go run .` in the `hello` directory to view the output of the code

To run unit tests, run `go test` in the any directory.
